## Cloud Development

This repository is developed using AWS Cloud 9 Ubuntu servers.

The first 12 months (for select services) are free and you can set up cost alerts to manage usage.

## Security

As of Rails 5.2, encrypted credentials are used instead of secrets.

To edit the credentials, run the following in the command line:

`EDITOR=vim rails credentials:edit`

The first time you edit, a master key is created.
